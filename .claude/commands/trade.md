---

Execute a manual trade with full rule validation. Refuse if any rule fails.

Args: SYMBOL SHARES SIDE (buy or sell). If missing, ask.

1. Pull state: account, positions, quote SYMBOL (capture ask price P).
2. For BUY, validate:
   - Total positions after fill <= 6
   - Trades this week + 1 <= 3
   - SHARES * P <= 20% of equity
   - SHARES * P <= available cash
   - daytrade_count < 3
   - Catalyst documented (ask for thesis if not in today's RESEARCH-LOG)
   If any fail, STOP and print the failed checks.
3. For SELL, confirm position exists with right qty. No other checks.
4. Print order JSON + validation results, ask "execute? (y/n)".
5. On confirm:
   bash scripts/alpaca.sh order '{"symbol":"SYM","qty":"N","side":"buy|sell","type":"market","time_in_force":"day"}'
6. For BUYs, immediately place 10% trailing stop GTC (same flow as market-open).
7. Log to memory/TRADE-LOG.md with full thesis, entry, stop, target, R:R.
8. bash scripts/telegram.sh with trade details.
